added lint, npm run eslint to execute, lint-test.js to check rules
added prettier, npm run prettier to execute, missing page to test and see stuff changing
added jest, npm run jest to execute,  script for running the tests is up, need to do code coverage
gonna start on using lefthook, its not using the commands i think




npm check-code - executes both lint, prettier and jest 
git add .;npx lefthook run pre-commit (simulate commit to see lefthook working)
