added lint, npm run eslint to execute, lint-test.js to check rules
added prettier, npm run prettier to execute, missing page to test and see stuff changing
just added jest, need to make the script, do a test files with several tests inside and then work on code coverage
gonna start on using lefthook, its not using the commands i think




npm check-code - executes both lint and prettier
